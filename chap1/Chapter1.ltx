\begin{mydef}{Some types of relations}{relations}
	A \textbf{relation} \textit{R} on $A$ can be seen as a subset of $A \times A$
	$$x R y \iff (x, y) \in R \subset A \times A$$
	\textit{R} on $A$ is said to be ...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Symmetric} iff $x R y \implies y R x$
		\item \textbf{Anti-symmetric} iff $x R y \land y R x \implies x = y$
		\item \textbf{Reflexive} iff $\forall x \in A, \enskip x R x$
		\item \textbf{Transitive} iff $x R y, \enskip y R z \implies x R z$
	\end{itemize}
	\tcblower
	A relation \textit{R} on \textit{A}  is said to be a \textbf{partial ordering} of A iff \textit{R} is ...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Transitive
		\item Reflexive
		\item Anti-symmetric
	\end{itemize}
	A relation \textit{R} on \textit{A}  is said to be an \textbf{equivalence relation} on A iff \textit{R} is ...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Transitive
		\item Reflexive
		\item Symmetric
	\end{itemize}
	Equivalence relations are frequently denoted by $\sim$ or $=$ \thinspace . Given an equivalence relation \tilde{} on $A$, the \textbf{equivalence class} of $x \in A$ is defined as follows
	$$ [x] = \{y \in A \enspace \mid \enspace x \sim y\}$$
	The collection of equivalence classes of \tilde{} on $A$ is denoted as ${}^A \! / \!_{\sim}$ and called \textbf{quotient set}.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}{Binary operation}{binaryoperation}
	A \textbf{binary operation} $*$ on set $A$ is a function
	\begin{align*}
		f : A \times A &\to A\\
			 (a, b) &\mapsto a * b
	\end{align*}
	A subset $E \subset A$ is said to be \textit{closed under *} iff $a, b \in E \implies a * b \in E$
	\tcblower	
	$*$ is said to be ...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Associative} iff $\forall a, b, c \in A$
			$$(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$$
		\item \textbf{Commutative} iff $\forall a, b \in A$
			$$a * b = b * a$$
	\end{itemize}
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}{Groupoids, Semi-groups, monoids \& Groups}{basicalgebras}
	Let $G$ be a set and $*$ a binary operation on said set. $\{G, *\}$ is said to be ...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ... a \textbf{groupoid}.
		\item ... a \textbf{semi-group} iff $*$ is associative.
		\item ... a \textbf{monoid} iff it is a semi-group and $*$ has an identity element : $$\exists e \in G \enspace \mid \enspace \forall x \in G, \enskip x * e = e * x = x$$
		\item ... a \textbf{group} iff it is a monoid and each element admits an inverse element (relative to $*$) : $$\forall x, \enspace \exists x^{-1} \in G \enspace \mid \enspace x * x^{-1} = e$$
	\end{itemize}
	\tcblower
	If, additionally, $*$ is commutative, the group is said to be \textit{Abelian}. Notice that in general you can define a group with only left-identity and left-inverse, and right-identity/inverse will follow. For a monoid, you can not stop at defining left-identity.
\end{mydef}
 
\begin{mydef}{Ring}{ring}
	A \textbf{ring} is a set $R$ together with two binary operations, $+$ \& $\cdot$, such that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $(F, +)$ forms an Abelian group with identity element 0
		\item $(F, \cdot)$ forms a monoid with identity element 1
		\item Operation $\cdot$ distributes (left \& right) over $+$
	\end{itemize}
	If additianally $\cdot$ is commutative the ring itself is said to be commutative.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}{Field}{field}
	A \textbf{field} is a set $F$ together with two binary operations, $+$ \& $\cdot$, such that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $(F, +)$ forms an Abelian group with identity element 0
		\item $(F\setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ forms an Abelian group with identity element 1
		\item Operation $\cdot$ distributes (left \& right) over $+$
	\end{itemize}
\end{mydef}

\begin{myprop}{Algebraic properties of the real numbers}{algebraicpropertiesrealnumbers}
	\begin{enumerate}[label = \roman*.]
		\item $\{\mathbb{ \mathbb{R}, \cdot, +}\}$ is a field
		\item $\leq$ is a total/connex ordering of $\mathbb{R}$
		\item $\mathbb{R}$ is order-complete under $\leq$
		\item $\leq$ is compatible with the field structure of $\mathbb{R}$ :
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $x \leq y \implies x + z \leq y + z$
				\item $x \geq 0 \land y \geq 0 \implies x \cdot y \geq 0$
			\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{myprop}

\begin{mydef}{Limit of sequence}{limit}
	Let \textit{X} be a topological space. A sequence $s : \mathbb{N} \to X $ has \textbf{limit} \textit{l} iff
	$$\forall M \in \mathcal{F}_l, \enspace \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \enspace \mid \enspace n \geq N \implies x_n \in M$$
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}{Limit of a function at a point}{limitoffunction}
	Let $X, Y$ be two topological spaces. A function $f : X \to Y$ has \textbf{limit} \textit{l} at the accumulation point $x_0$ iff for all neighborhoods of \textit{l}, there exists a neighborhood of $x_0$ such that the image of the neighborhood of $x_0$ is contained in the neighborhood of \textit{l} . Mathematically,
	$$\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x) = l \iff \forall N \in \mathcal{F}_l, \enskip \exists M \in \mathcal{F}_{x_0} \enspace \mid \enspace f(M) \subset N$$
	If $x_0$ is not an accumulation point, there exists a neighborhood whose image is a singleton or the empty set, which will trivially satisfy the requirement.
\end{mydef}
\begin{myremark} 
	A sequence converging to some limit can be seen as a special case of \ref{def:limitoffunction} with $\mathbb{N}$ equipped with the \textit{right order topology}.
\end{myremark}
\begin{mydef}{Continuity}{continuity}
	Let $X, Y$ be two topological spaces. A function $f : X \to Y$ is \textbf{continuous} at the accumulation point $x_0 \in X$ iff the limit of the function at $x_0$ is equal to the value of the function at said point. Mathematically,
	$$ f \text{ is continuous at } x_0 \iff \lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0)$$
	$f$ is said to be \textit{globally continuous} iff it is continuous at every point in $A$
\end{mydef}
\begin{mydef}{Derivative}{derivative}
	Let $x_0 \in A \subset \mathbb{R}$ an accumulation point. A real number $f'(x_0)$ is said to be the \textbf{derivative} of $f$ at $x_0$ iff
	$$f'(x_0) = \lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0}$$
	If $f'(a)$ exists, the function is \textit{differentiable at a}. If it is differentiable at each point of $A$, the function is \textit{differentiable on A}\\[1mm]
